#  Determining ISF & Impact of Exercise on Blood Sugar at Different Times of the Day

What three units of insulin do to my blood sugar in the morning is unrecognisable from what they do in the evening. Courtesy of the dawn phenomena, if I am lucky, three units of insulin in the morning brings me down about 30 mg/dl. In the evening, however, 3 units of insulin can wreak havoc and bring me down more than 100 mg/dl. 
Moreover, it is not just the ISF magnitude that changes at different times of the day but also the dynamics of insulin absorption. I have observed that the peak time for absorption tends to come a lot later in the morning as compared to other parts of the day. To test my hypotheses and to calculate my insulin sensitivity factor at different times of the day, I used my blood sugar data after taking a 3 unit insulin correction dose at different times of the day to compare how my insulin sensitivity factor varies throughout the day. I tried to pick data where my days looked largely similar (in terms of activity, schedule and food) and divided the day into 3 portions based on the variations I had observed: 

- Morning- 4am to 11am
- Day - 11am to 8pm
- Night-8pm-4am

I also compared blood sugar trends after exercise (30 minutes of jogging) in the morning and in the evening.

## Trends

Insulin absorption peaks at round 140 minutes in the morning, 60 minutes in the day and 80 minutes at night. 
- Morning ISF = 13 mg/dl per unit
- Day ISF = 25 mg/dl per unit
- Night ISF = 30 mg/dl per unit


This variation could be attributed to the release of certain hormones or varying basal absorption at different times of the day.

The impact of exercise in the morning and evening are completely opposite. In the morning, exercise causes blood sugar levels to rise and in the evening it causes them to drop.


The code can also predict blood sugar trends after an event. Using the regression equations, I can get an idea of what kind of change to expect based on the time of the day. The idea is to eliminate the cognitive burden of type one diabetes by having all the information you need to make the right management decisions
